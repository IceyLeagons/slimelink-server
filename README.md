# SlimeLink Server
This is the official server for our project called [SlimeLink](https://github.com/IceyLeagons/slimelink).

It includes a UDP and a WebSocket (TCP) server by default. By default, both servers are started - this is customizable (**not yet**)
## Quick notes
**Currently there's no way to change the base port other than to re-build the whole project.**
By default the SlimeLink server uses the ports: *8769* and *8770*

## Installation
Download the latest release from the Releases page on Github, and just run the jar file.
